# Spin-Calculation
Provides a UI to place and link spins, then solves for the lowest energy states.

This project aims to help provide a UI for users studying the low energy states of spin systems.
There are 3 main steps to using this UI:
1. In the user interface, users can drag & place spins onto a grid to arrange them to match their spin system of interest.
2. Switching to the interaction interface, users can link spins to represent spin-spin interactions.
3. By pressing the calculate button, the system will find the lowest energy states and display them on screen.


Current status:
-In building mode
-Need to add error checks

Future add-on/plans:
-Better diagrams for spins
-Choice of spin-spin interaction strength, J
-Ability to choose values of J for different interactions
-Better desgin of UI

Far in the future:
-Possibility of infinite chain representation/DMRG
